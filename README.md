# YelpForAll

Welcome to my app! This is a simple Sinatra form app I made in a day to practice skills I was learning at Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program. YelpForAll is an app where users can write reviews about the accessibility of different businesses. After writing the review, they can see their completed review, then return to the home screen.

## How to Use?

In your terminal, change directory until you are in the folder 'app'. Then run 'bundle exec shotgun'. In your browser, go to

localhost:9393

to see the welcome page. You can then write a review, submit it, see the review you wrote, and return to the welcome page.

Enjoy!
